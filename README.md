## Objectives

Import, analyze, clean, and preprocess a “real-world” classification dataset.
Select, design, and train a binary classification model of your choosing.
Optimize model training and input data to achieve desired model performance.
## Results

How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?


Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?
